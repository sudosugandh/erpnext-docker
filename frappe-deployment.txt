Express dependency between services, which has two effects:
1 docker-compose up will start services in dependency order. In the following example, mariadb and redis will be started before frappe.
2 docker-compose up SERVICE will automatically include SERVICE’s dependencies. In the following example, docker-compose up docker_frappe will also create and start mariadb and redis.
Make sure your current directory is frappe_docker
1 First time setup
./dbench init-frappe
./dbench init-erpnext(if you want to install the erpnext app)

2 Command to be executed everytime after starting your containers
./dbench setup hosts

3 Command to enter your container
./dbench
